# Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement
The dictation feature in Raycast AI Assistant has significant startup latency that frustrates users. While the actual dictation works well, users experience delays of 1-2 seconds before they can start speaking, creating a poor user experience for a feature that should feel instant and responsive.

## Current State
What's broken/missing today (specific user frustrations):
- **Blocking system checks**: `system_profiler` call takes 500ms-2s to check audio input device
- **Slow local model validation**: Parakeet installation checks run multiple shell commands (uv tool list, etc.) taking 500ms-2s on first run
- **Sequential startup flow**: All checks run one after another instead of in parallel
- **No progress feedback**: Users wait without knowing what's happening during startup
- **Redundant checks**: Same expensive operations run on every command invocation
- **No graceful degradation**: One slow check blocks the entire startup process

## Solution
Implement a multi-pronged performance optimization strategy:

### 1. Parallel Execution
- Run audio setup, model availability, and OpenAI client checks in parallel using `Promise.all()`
- Eliminate sequential blocking operations in startup flow

### 2. Intelligent Caching
- Cache `system_profiler` results for the session or until hardware changes
- Memoize Parakeet installation status with smart invalidation
- Preload and cache OpenAI client settings in memory

### 3. Deferred Non-Critical Checks
- Move expensive audio device verification after UI is shown
- Allow users to proceed with warnings if non-critical checks are slow
- Provide manual "recheck" option for cached results

### 4. Enhanced User Feedback
- Show progress indicators during system checks
- Provide immediate UI with "checking system..." status
- Display specific check status (audio, models, API) independently

### 5. Code Optimizations
- Replace synchronous file operations with async where beneficial
- Optimize local model detection logic
- Implement smarter model availability caching

## User Impact
How this helps:
- **Instant responsiveness**: Reduce startup time from 1-2s to <200ms for cached scenarios
- **Better user experience**: No more waiting before dictation starts
- **Improved reliability**: Parallel checks reduce failure cascades
- **Time saved**: 1-2 seconds saved per dictation session × daily usage = significant productivity gain
- **Frustration reduced**: Eliminates the "why is this taking so long?" moment

## Success Criteria
✅ Dictation startup completes in <200ms for cached scenarios
✅ No single system check blocks the entire startup process
✅ Progress feedback shows during any operations >100ms
✅ Works on existing projects without breaking functionality
✅ User can complete dictation task faster than before
✅ Maintains reliability and error handling quality
✅ Graceful degradation when system checks are slow

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- **Cold start**: <500ms (first run after install)
- **Warm start**: <200ms (subsequent runs with cache)
- **Parallel execution**: All independent checks run simultaneously
- **Cache hit rate**: >90% for system checks during session

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Implement parallel execution of existing checks
2. **Phase 2**: Add intelligent caching for expensive operations
3. **Phase 3**: Enhance user feedback and progress indicators
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize code and add graceful degradation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Maintain existing error handling and user safety
- Preserve all current functionality and features
- Ensure cache invalidation works correctly
- Add performance monitoring and telemetry

## Dependencies
- Existing codebase: dictate.tsx, audio.ts, local-models.ts, openai-client.ts
- Performance profiler system (already implemented)
- Raycast API for UI and storage
- No external dependencies required

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Parallel execution introduces race conditions
  - **Mitigation**: Careful design of independent checks, proper error handling
- **Risk**: Caching introduces stale data issues
  - **Mitigation**: Smart cache invalidation, manual refresh option
- **Risk**: Performance regression in error scenarios
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain comprehensive error handling, add fallbacks
