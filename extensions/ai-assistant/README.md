# AI Assistant for Raycast

Imagine a personal assistant integrated directly into your Mac, capable of writing, rephrasing, correcting, summarizing and translating your texts in a flash. Have an idea? Dictate it, and it transforms it into clear and precise notes. Want it to write for you, ask it, and it delivers or updates a text for you.

All of this, without waiting for Apple Intelligence to be ready and without needing a latest-generation Mac! Enjoy a smooth, fast, and intuitive AI, accessible to everyone, directly from your keyboard.
